This is an early-stage 2D tile-based game framework written in Rust using the [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/) engine.  
Although I'm developing this for personal use, anyone is welcome to use any/all of it [for any purpose and without any condition](https://github.com/Elgenzay/bevy-tilegame-base/blob/main/LICENSE).
